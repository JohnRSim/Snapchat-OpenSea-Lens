# What are Snap Spectacles???
Create the world you want to see with Spectacles â€“ Snaps first pair of glasses that bring augmented reality to life, redefining how creators interact with and overlay computing on the world. 

Hoping in the near future that Snap will allow immersive experiences via users own NFTs and link in and pull their 3D NFTs to create rich mixed reality experiences and new approach for creating visually rich  content creation.
